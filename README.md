### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    This ensures all project dependencies are isolated and do not conflict with other Python projects on your machine.

    **On macOS and Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** First, clone the repository, then install all required libraries using `pip`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Browser Binaries:** This is a crucial step for Playwright.
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

4.  **Create `.env` File:** Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add all your credentials. The script reads these to operate.
    ```ini
    # Naukri Credentials
    NAUKRI_EMAIL="your_naukri_email"
    NAUKRI_PASSWORD="your_naukri_password"

    # Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"

    # LinkedIn Credentials (Optional for messaging fallback)
    LINKEDIN_EMAIL="your_linkedin_email"
    LINKEDIN_PASSWORD="your_linkedin_password"

    # API Keys for Job Discovery (Optional)
    ADZUNA_APP_ID="your_adzuna_id"
    ADZUNA_APP_KEY="your_adzuna_key"
    RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_rapidapi_key"

    # Resume Path (PDF format)
    RESUME_PATH="/path/to/your/resume.pdf"
    ```

5.  **Edit `config.json`:**
    * Modify `roles`, `locations`, `experience`, and `keywords` to match your preferences.
    * Adjust `apply_pacing` to control the time between each application.
    * Set the `discovery` mode to `scrape`, `api`, or `hybrid`.

### Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

You can run the agent in two modes:

* **Single Run:** Runs through the job search and application process once, then exits.
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```

* **Continuous Loop:** Runs continuously, checking for new jobs every `AGENT_INTERVAL_MIN` (default 60 minutes) as defined in your environment variables.
    ```bash
    python agent.py --loop
    ```

To run in **headless mode** (without a visible browser), set the `HEADLESS` environment variable:
```bash
HEADLESS=1 python agent.py
```

### Logs and Outputs üìù

The agent creates several files to track its activity and provide a record of your job applications:
* `applied_jobs.log`: A human-readable list of all jobs the agent successfully applied to.
* `skipped_log.csv`: A CSV file of jobs skipped due to keyword or experience mismatches.
* `hr_contact_log.txt`: A log of HR contact information for jobs where a direct message couldn't be sent.
* `external_apply_log.csv`: A CSV file of jobs that require you to complete the application on an external website.
